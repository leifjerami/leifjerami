## Hello WorldðŸ––

I just got back into coding after a long break. Never considered myself a real coder or developer before â€” more of a hobbyist, exploring things here and there.

But after some frustrations with no-code tools and, well, dealing with difficult, _ahem_ c0d\*\*s, I decided it's time to give coding another try.

What's a better time to dive in than now? I've recently moved to another country, and with new projects piling up, it's the perfect moment to get serious about building things â€” with codes!
